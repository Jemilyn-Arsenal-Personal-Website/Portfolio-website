            The Beginning
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since I was young, I've had a keen interest in technology, particularly websites and applications.
            Therefore,
            when Amazon presented an opportunity to pursue a career in web development through their career choice
            program,
            I
            seized it,and now I am on my path towards becoming a web developer.

        </p>
        <h2 id="vision"> My Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Developing applications that simplify people's lives.
        </p>

        <h2 id="like"> What I like</h2>

        <h3 class="i-like"> Coding </h3>
        <p>Lately, I have been dedicating a significant amount of time and effort towards improving my coding skills,
            with the goal of becoming a proficient programmer. I recognize the importance of coding in today's digital
            world, and I am
            determined to achieve excellence in this area.<br>
            While I know that becoming an excellent coder will require dedication and hard work, I am excited about the
            prospect of developing my skills in this field. I find coding to be a fascinating and rewarding activity,
            and I
            am eager
            to see how my knowledge and abilities will grow over time. </p>
        <h3 class="i-like"> Pet </h3>
        <p>From a young age, I have been drawn to the charm and companionship of pets, especially cats and dogs. They
            have always
            held a special place in my heart and I find great comfort in their presence </p>
        <h3 class="i-like"> Travel </h3>
        <p>Whenever I have some free time on my hands, one of my favorite things to do is to explore small towns and
            nature
            reserves. I find great pleasure in taking a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and immersing
            myself in
            the natural beauty of the world around us.

            One of my preferred ways to explore these places is by driving through different towns and soaking up the
            local culture
            and scenery. I enjoy checking out the unique architecture, sampling the local cuisine, and taking in the
            sights and
            sounds of each new place. </p>
        <h3 class="i-like"> Food </h3>
        <p>
            I have a deep love for food and enjoy exploring different cuisines. I have a particular affinity for rice
            and
            often
            include it in my meals, as I find it to be a versatile and delicious staple.<br>
            One of my favorite things to do is to try out different types of cuisine, whether it be exploring a new
            restaurant or
            experimenting with new recipes at home. I find that food is not just about nourishment, but also about
            experiencing
            different cultures and connecting with others over a shared love of delicious food.
